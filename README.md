  </h1>
  <p>
         A Weather App using an API provides real-time weather data by integrating information from a weather service provider. The app requests data such as current conditions, forecasts, and weather alerts using the API key obtained from services like OpenWeatherMap or Weatherbit. The user interface displays this data, often including features like location-based weather updates, interactive maps, and customization options. The app continuously fetches updated information from the API, ensuring users have access to the latest weather information wherever they are.
